# HI THIS IS MY WEBSITE

Mar 20 2025

So here's my website. I'm gonna use this as my resume/portfolio site and try to get this hosted on a
server or something. Pretty sure github pages lets you host a site for free, right?

Anyway yeah this is also my web programming practice page, because once I get this up and running, I'll actually be motivated to keep up with it, like when you work out and you're like "yeah I should probably do that again." So I'll be learning more about being a web developer by using this site

So I'm back to editing this and I honestly think it looks great so far. I'm going to focus on adding PRACTICAL things now. Including:
- A subpage displaying my resume
- A subpage providing my business contact info
