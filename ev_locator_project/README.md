# Closest Electric Vehicle Charging Station to Your Location

This is a web application which displays the location of the electric vehicle charging station closest to a user's geographic location. The project spans the majority of Houston, Texas.

The website uses Geolocation API to request user's geographic information and Google Maps API to display map data. I went with the Haversine distance formula to calculate the distances from each point in the coordinate dataset.

Data on EV charging stations provided by City of Houston Open Data at https://data.houstontx.gov/
